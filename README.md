STProjectMaker
===================

A Sublime Text 2 plug-in to allow creating any kind of project from your own custom templates.

## Installation

### Via Package Control:

1. Install Package Control from http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control

2. From within Package Control, look for STPackageMaker and install.

### Manually:

Clone or download this project into a folder named "STProjectMaker" in your Sublime Text 2 Packages folder. If you're not sure where your Packages folder is, use menu `Preferences/Browse Packages...`

Optionally, set up a key binding. I like to override Control-Shift-N in menu `Preferences/Key Bindings - User`

	[
		{ "keys": ["ctrl+shift+n"], "command": "project_maker" }
	]

## Usage

Invoking the command will show a Quick Panel list of available templates.

Choose the template to base your project on.

You will be prompted to enter a path for your new project. Do so.

You will be prompted for values for any replaceable tokens in any template files or file names. Enter the values you want to use.

Newly created project folder will open in system file manager.

## Creating and Modifying Templates

A template is simply a folder stored in `<sublime packages dir>/STProjectMaker/Templates/`. It can contain any number and types of files and nested folders of files.

### Tokens

Text files in the template may contain replaceable tokens in the form of `${token_name}`. When you create a new project, you will be prompted for values to use for each token found. The same token can be used multiple times in multiple files. You will only be prompted a single time for its value.

Example:

	Hello from ${user_name}

when supplied a value of `Keith` for the `user_name` token will become:

	Hello from Keith

### Tokenized File Names

Template file names may also be tokenized using the form `_token_name_.ext`. The leading underscore, token name and trailing underscore will be replaced by the value given.

Example:

	/foo/bar/baz/_info_file_.text

when supplied with a value of `data` for the `info_file` token will become:

	/foo/bar/baz/data.text

### Predefined Tokens

There are two predefined tokens:

`${project_path}` in text files will be replaced by the absolute path of the new project directory.

`${project_name}` in text files or `_project_name_` as a file name will be replaced by the base name of the project directory.

Example:

Project path is `/foo/bar/baz/MyProject/`

`project_path` will be replaced by `/foo/bar/baz/MyProject/`

`project_name` will be replaced by `MyProject`

### Sublime Project files

If the chosen template has a `.sublime-project` file in the top level, that file will be copied over and processed like any other file in the template. However, if this does not exist, a default `.sublime-project` file will be created using the `project_name` token as its base name. 

### Ignored Files

Obviously, you don't want to try to do token replacement in binary files. The plug-in has a long list of file types that it will ignore when doing token replacement. You can always add your own if any files in your templates cause a problem. The list is contained in the `STProjectMaker.sublime-settings` file. Note, these files _will_ be copied into the project. They will just not be parsed for tokens.

### Auto File Downloading and Other Tasks

Todd Anderson (`http://custardbelly.com/blog/`) has created an additional configuration feature that I have added to the project. This allows additional functions to be run after the project is created to perform additional tasks. 

The one task it is currently capable of performing is downloading files and adding them to your project. This can be useful if you want every project you create to have the latest version of a particular library such as jQuery. The files to download are defined with a `config.json` file in the template. You can see an example of how this works in the `AppRequire.js` template. Known issue: the file task will fail on https urls under Linux. This is because the version of Python bundled with Sublime Text 2 under Linux does not include the ssl module for reasons I am not quite clear on.

Note that if your template does not have a `config.json` file, this step will be ignored. Additional tasks can be created following the current example. Thus, it is sort of plug-in for a plug-in.
